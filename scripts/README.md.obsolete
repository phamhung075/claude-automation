# Legacy Bash Scripts (DEPRECATED)

⚠️ **DEPRECATED**: These bash scripts are legacy code and are no longer the primary orchestration method.

**Use Rust tools instead**: See `../README.md` for current documentation on `cclaude-rs` and `claude-inject`.

---

## Why Deprecated?

The bash-based orchestration system has been replaced with high-performance Rust-based launchers that provide:

✅ Better performance and reliability
✅ Cross-platform terminal support
✅ Worker registry and management
✅ Message injection capabilities
✅ Proper tmux session handling

---

## Migration Guide

### Old (Bash) → New (Rust)

| Old Bash Script | New Rust Tool | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|-------|
| `autonomous_orchestrator.sh` | `cclaude-rs` + `claude-inject spawn-worker` | Use spawn-worker for autonomous execution |
| Manual `claude -p` calls | `cclaude-rs --agent <agent>` | Interactive sessions with agent auto-loading |
| Custom tmux management | `claude-inject tmux-inject` | Built-in tmux message injection |
| Manual worker tracking | `claude-inject list-workers` | Automatic worker registry |

### Example Migration

**Before (Bash)**:
```bash
# Old way - manually spawn claude with prompts
./scripts/autonomous_orchestrator.sh
```

**After (Rust)**:
```bash
# New way - spawn worker with agent auto-loading
cd ../rust-injector
./target/release/claude-inject spawn-worker \
    --name worker-autonomous \
    --agent coding-agent \
    --dir /path/to/project \
    --prompt "Complete the task"
```

## What These Scripts Did

### autonomous_orchestrator.sh
- Ran infinite loop coordinating agents via `claude -p`
- Used MCP API for task management
- File-based coordination

**Replacement**: `claude-inject spawn-worker` with proper worker registry

### agent_prompts_with_knowledge.sh
- Managed agent prompts with shared knowledge base
- File-based knowledge sharing

**Replacement**: Use MCP context system in parent project

### demo_agent_communication.sh
- Demonstrated multi-agent communication
- File-based message passing

**Replacement**: Use tmux-inject for agent communication

### shared_knowledge_manager.sh
- Managed shared knowledge files
- Cross-agent knowledge sharing

**Replacement**: Use MCP context hierarchy (Global→Project→Branch→Task)

### start_autonomous_workflow.sh
- Started autonomous workflow execution
- Wrapper for orchestrator

**Replacement**: Direct `claude-inject spawn-worker` usage

### start-websocket-coordinator.sh
- Started WebSocket coordinator (still active)
- **NOT deprecated** - see `../src/websocket-coordinator/`

## If You Still Need Bash Scripts

These scripts are kept for reference but are no longer maintained. If you absolutely need bash-based orchestration:

1. They may still work but are unsupported
2. No bug fixes or updates will be made
3. Use at your own risk
4. Consider contributing Rust equivalent features instead
